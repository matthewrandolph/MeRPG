# MeRPG
## Inspiration
As a group there was two main interests that we could agree on, fitness and gaming. So as a group we decided to find a way to connect both and came up with Me RPG.

## What It Does
Me RPG is a website where you can level up your avatar by doing the exercises yourself. For example if you went running for an hour you input it into RPG in order to level up your avatar.

## How We Built It
Characters were created in Sims 3 and then cropped and edited.
