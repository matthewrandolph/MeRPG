# MeRPG

## Note to Developers:
This project is built using MySQL. As such, without an appropriate database and database connection files, this project will throw a bunch of error messages, complaining of missing files and the like. Keep that in mind if you decide to download or fork this project!

## Inspiration
As a group there were two main interests that we could agree on - fitness and gaming. So as a group, we decided to find a way to connect both and came up with Me RPG.

## What It Does
Me RPG is a task gamification web application. When you start with Me RPG, you are given a low-level avatar that you level up by performing and logging time you spend completing certain tasks that encourage good physical and mental health including exercise, reading, sleeping, and socializing.

## How We Built It
My RPG is primarily built in PHP, with a splattering of raw HTML, Javascript, and CSS Markup.

Characters were created in Sims 3 and then cropped and edited.

Our code editors of choice were TextWrangler and Atom.

## Challenges We Ran Into
Our biggest challenge was finding the best system and tools to collaborate on our project.  We were able to set up a GitHub system that tracked changes between our team members.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
Our biggest accomplishment is creating a functioning and successful project.

## What We Learned
We learned how much easier it is to work on such a project with tracking and collaborative tools like GitHub.

## What's Next for Me RPG
In the future, Me RPG plans to reveal new characters to be unlocked at certain levels, a mobile app interface, connecting to activity monitors such as the Fitbit, and the possibility of battling other people's avatars.  Another thought to encourage use of the app is to penalize users who don't consistently enter tasks completed by taking away experience points and potentially leveling down their character.

Me RPG will also be integrated with an open-source RPG game where the character's avatar will be reflected in the character in the game -- the stats of the character will be based on the stats of the avatar.
