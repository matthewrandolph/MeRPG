# MeRPG

## Note to Developers:
This project is built using MySQL. As such, without an appropriate database and database connection files, this project will throw a bunch of error messages, complaining of missing files and the like. Keep that in mind if you decide to download or fork this project!

## Inspiration
As a group there was two main interests that we could agree on, fitness and gaming. So as a group we decided to find a way to connect both and came up with Me RPG.

## What It Does
Me RPG is a task gamification web application. When you start with Me RPG, you are given a low-level avatar that you can level up by performing healthy tasks, such as exercise, yourself.

## How We Built It
My RPG is primarily built in PHP, with a splattering of raw HTML, Javascript, and CSS Markup.

Characters were created in Sims 3 and then cropped and edited.

Our code editors of choice were TextWrangler and Atom.
